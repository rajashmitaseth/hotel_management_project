# Hotel Management Project (NOT UPDATED)
Class 12 Board Project

## Description
I've built this project using Python (GUI application) and MySQL (Database). This hotel management desktop application is meant to be operated from the front desk or the hotel's administration. I've named the hotel `Sylas` and used photos of a European hotel which I found online. I've stuck to a `Creme`, `Orange` and `Blue` theme for the whole application. With this desktop application, the admin can do the following tasks:
+ `Add`, `Edit` and `Delete` a registration
+ `Add`, `Edit` and `Delete` a room
+ `Generate` a bill
+ `Export` the bill as a `.txt file` to `print` it

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
+ OS version must be Windows 10 or above.

### Installing
+ Required MySQL databases and tables must be constructed before running the application
+ Save files and run
