# Hotel Management Project
Class 12 Board Project

## Description
I've built this project using Python (GUI application) and MySQL (Database). This hotel management desktop application is meant to be operated from the front desk or by the hotel's administrator. I've named the hotel `Sylas` and used photos of a European hotel sourced from the internet. 

### Colour scheme
I've stuck to a `Creme`, `Orange` and `Blue` theme for the whole application.

### Functions
With this desktop application, the admin can do the following tasks:
+ `Add`, `Edit` and `Delete` a Registration in the Reservations tab
+ `Add`, `Edit` and `Delete` a Room in the Rooms tab
+ `Add` items to and `Delete` items from a Bill in the Payments tab
+ `Generate` a Bill for a particular Reservation
+ `Export` the Bill as a `.txt file` to `print` it using a local printer

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
+ OS version must be Windows 10 or above
+ Python 3 or above
+ 

### Installing
+ Required MySQL databases and tables must be constructed before running the application
+ Edit the `user`, `password` and `host` in `dbconnection.py`
+ Save files and run
